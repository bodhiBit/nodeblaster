nodeblaster
===========

A bomberman-like multiplayer game for node with socket.io

As you can see, the game is in dire need for some appealing graphics, which I am
not at all good at.. Any help would be appreciated.. :)

The game is inspired by the good old Amiga game
[Dyna Blaster](http://youtu.be/LDkYTl1qGcs?t=20m30s)..

How to install and run the game (on Windows)
--------------------------------------------

 - Download this repo by clicking the ZIP-button at the top of this page, or use git to clone it
 - Unpack it (if you downloaded the zip-file)
 - Find start.bat and run it
   - If it opens nodejs.org in your browser, you need to install node.js from there and run start.bat again
 - The game should now run and open in your browser :)
   - Share the link to play together with others on your local network.. (you may need to substitute the hostname with your ip-address)

Have fun..! :D
