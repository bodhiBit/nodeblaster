nodeblaster
===========

A bomberman like multiplayer game for node and socket.io

As you can see, the game is in dire need for some appealing graphics, which I am
not at all good at.. Any help would be appreciated.. :)

The game is inspired by the good old Amiga game
[Dyna Blaster](http://youtu.be/LDkYTl1qGcs?t=20m30s)..
